# Dark Factory control plane

This directory is the self-contained implementation of the deployed
`dark-factory-control-plane` service. It is not a `dark-factory` workspace
member and never links to or runs inside `factoryd`.

The service is a Rust Cloudflare Worker backed by SQLite Durable Objects. It
keeps GitHub App credentials outside agent processes and exposes only reviewed,
typed operations over MCP. Every operation names the `owner/name` repository it
acts on, and can reach only repositories this App is installed on. Deployment
state is verified separately; source control is not evidence that a route,
Access policy, or App configuration is live.

## Current surface

- `GET /healthz` proves only that the Worker can answer.
- `GET /readyz` returns 200 only when the three webhook authority bindings are
  valid and the Durable Object binding, SQLite schema, and migration marker
  pass their audit. When App authority is configured, readiness also imports
  the private key, signs an App JWT, and verifies that the key belongs to the
  configured App. Readiness names no repository: which repositories the App may
  act on is the installation's answer, established per operation when a token is
  minted, not a deployment setting. A partial or syntactically invalid
  App-authority group makes the whole Worker inactive.
- `POST /v1/github/maintainer/webhook` accepts only a bounded GitHub webhook.
  It verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` over the exact body with HMAC-SHA-256,
  limits the body to 64 KiB, requires one value for every security header,
  requires an `integration` target, and binds the configured App ID.
- A valid `ping` is the only acknowledged event. When all operation-authority
  bindings are present, acknowledgement also requires an RS256 App JWT, one
  App identity proving the private key belongs to the configured App. Every
  other authenticated event is
  journalled as `policy_rejected`
  and returns 422. No payload can create a task, message, prompt, provider run,
  or GitHub mutation.
- `POST /mcp` is a stateless Streamable HTTP MCP JSON-RPC endpoint. It is
  installed only with the complete operation authority. Its 52 MiB envelope
  ceiling is derived above the largest request the typed publication schema
  permits (50 files with 1,000,000 encoded characters each), rather than
  reusing the webhook's unrelated 64 KiB limit or adding a lower aggregate
  limit. The endpoint is reached only after Cloudflare Access has supplied
  one authenticated JWT assertion
  identifying exactly one of two configured principals: the operator's email
  identity, or — when `DARK_FACTORY_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_SERVICE_TOKEN_ID` is
  bound — one exact Access **service token**, which is how the surface is
  reached headlessly with no human present. Each principal's claim set rejects
  the other's shape, so neither can take the other's path. Its finite typed
  tools observe the default head and durable operation state, manage a bounded
  issue lifecycle, publish an exact commit and pull request, submit an exact-head
  `ALLOW`, `COMMENT`, or `REQUEST_CHANGES` verdict, diagnose and rerun exact CI,
  observe eventual merge state, enqueue through the merge queue, publish and
  observe immutable releases, and dispatch only the two fixed reviewed recovery
  and deployment workflows. GitHub's `delete_branch_on_merge` repository setting
  performs atomic source-branch cleanup; the broker never deletes a ref itself. All three verdicts are the repository's own words,
  not GitHub review states -- the App opens the pull requests it
  reviews, and GitHub refuses a self-review that takes a side, `APPROVE` and
  `REQUEST_CHANGES` alike -- so every one of them is posted as `COMMENT`
  carrying a `Dark-Factory-Review:` line the App renders and refuses in caller
  text. The `review` status check reads that line to enforce AGENTS.md rule 2;
  see `docs/development/WORKFLOW.md`. Each write's operation UUID is accepted
  in either case and canonicalized to lowercase, so one UUID is one replay
  identity however the caller's `uuidgen` spelled it. There is no direct-merge
  tool: a required
  merge queue makes GitHub refuse `PUT /pulls/{n}/merge` outright, and
  `docs/development/GITHUB_APP.md` had already ruled it out ("the broker does
  not ... expose direct merge as a fallback"). Enqueue is the only automated
  path to `main`. Publication refuses the `.github` authority tree, and every
  write is bound to a stated head commit and to a durable operation ID.
  There is no generic GitHub proxy, arbitrary URL, shell, direct merge,
  arbitrary ref/workflow mutation, or credential-returning tool. Operations name
  the repository they act on, and reach only repositories this App is installed
  on: the installation is the boundary, not a configured name.
  A publication cannot target the
  live default branch: generated refs move only forward from a stated head or
  disappear after their exact pull request is proven merged.
- The product webhook and operator/PWA namespaces have no routes.

Missing, empty, partial, or syntactically invalid authority produces the fixed
inactive router: liveness remains 200, readiness is 503, and the webhook route
is not installed. An unusable key, live GitHub drift, or storage failure keeps
the configured route fail-closed and returns 503 without acknowledging a
delivery. Responses never contain configuration, GitHub, or storage errors.

## Durable replay and operation model

The Worker binds one `MaintainerDeliveryJournal` SQLite Durable Object
namespace. Object names include the configured App ID and one byte of the
SHA-256 digest of the GitHub delivery ID. This gives 256 deterministic shards
per App: every use of one delivery ID reaches the same strongly consistent
object without turning the whole service into a global singleton.

Each shard creates the reviewed SQLite schema on first use, records the exact
migration digest, and audits both stored table definitions and the migration
row before readiness or delivery work. The delivery ID is the primary key. An
insert uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, then compares the complete stored replay
identity: hook ID, App target, target type, event, parsed action, body digest,
disposition, and webhook-secret revision. An exact replay returns its stored
result; any changed binding returns 409.

Durable Object serialization and the unique key make concurrent exact replay
collapse and conflicting-body behavior deterministic. SQLite state is not part
of a Worker code rollback; deployment and data rollback remain separate
operator decisions. Cloudflare documents SQLite Durable Objects as strongly
consistent and transactionally isolated, with encrypted storage and point-in-
time recovery. See the official [SQLite storage API], [Durable Object rules],
and [data security] documentation.

Maintainer writes use a separate reviewed table in the same Durable Object
namespace. The UUID operation ID is bound to the SHA-256 digest of the complete
typed request and one fixed operation kind. Its state machine is
`planned -> executing -> completed`; `indeterminate` records an ambiguous
external outcome. An atomic transition gives exactly one caller permission to
invoke GitHub. A retry with the same ID and request replays the completed result
or reconciles against the operation marker and exact commit IDs. A different
request under the same ID conflicts. Read-only operation observation reports
whether a UUID was never received, is in flight, became indeterminate, or
completed, including the stored request digest and typed result. If an
executing or indeterminate operation cannot be reconciled, it is never blindly
submitted again.

GitHub App installation tokens are minted only inside the Worker, scoped to the
one repository the operation names, and downscoped per operation. They are held
in zeroizing memory and are never returned or journalled. The permanent App may
have additional installed capabilities; unused App-level authority is never
copied into an operation token.

The Actions-write, checks-read, contents-write, issues-write,
merge-queues-write, metadata-read, and pull-requests-write minimum is enforced
when a token is minted, not at readiness. Readiness names no repository, so it
has no installation to audit; an installation that is suspended, is not
selected-repository, or lacks one of those grants is refused at the operation
that needs it, and the refusal names the field that failed.

Native SQLite remains behind the non-default `development-sqlite` feature. It
is a fast causal model for the webhook contract and deliberately cannot make
readiness succeed. Production contains no Postgres, Neon, database URL,
runtime database role, Vercel adapter, or provider management API.

## Cloudflare configuration

`wrangler.toml` deliberately has:

- `workers_dev = false`;
- `preview_urls = false`;
- no route or custom domain;
- one capability-style Durable Object binding; and
- eight required production secret bindings.

The exact required bindings are:

- `DARK_FACTORY_MAINTAINER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: the byte-exact GitHub webhook
  secret, 32-1024 bytes;
- `DARK_FACTORY_MAINTAINER_WEBHOOK_SECRET_REVISION`: a bounded lowercase
  revision such as `maintainer-v1`; and
- `DARK_FACTORY_MAINTAINER_APP_ID`: the positive numeric App ID expected in
  `X-GitHub-Hook-Installation-Target-ID`;
- `DARK_FACTORY_MAINTAINER_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8`: standard-base64 encoding of the
  App's unencrypted PKCS#8 DER private key;
- `DARK_FACTORY_MAINTAINER_PERMISSION_REVISION`: exactly
  `maintainer-operations-v3` for this authority revision;
- `DARK_FACTORY_MAINTAINER_OPERATOR_EMAIL_SHA256`: lowercase SHA-256 of the one
  Cloudflare Access operator email after ASCII lowercasing;
- `DARK_FACTORY_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`: the exact lowercase
  `https://<team>.cloudflareaccess.com` issuer and key origin; and
- `DARK_FACTORY_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_AUD`: the exact lowercase 64-hex application
  audience tag.

One further binding is deliberately outside the all-or-nothing group:

- `DARK_FACTORY_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_SERVICE_TOKEN_ID`: the exact
  `<32-hex>.access` client ID of the one Access service token allowed to act
  headlessly. Absent, every service-token assertion is rejected and only the
  operator identity can reach `/mcp`; it never means "any service token".
  Because it is optional and inherited across versions, `/readyz` names which
  principals are live — `mcp_installation_bound_operator_and_headless` or
  `mcp_installation_bound_operator_only` — and the deployment gate requires the
  former.

The revisions and numeric IDs are stored as secrets too. They are not
confidential, but treating all authority settings identically avoids a
dashboard/source split and makes a missing value block upload or deployment
through Wrangler's required-secret validation. The App-authority group is
all-or-nothing at runtime. There are no aliases or ambient fallbacks.

A Cloudflare Access application must protect the exact `/mcp` application path
before the route receives traffic. A service token needs a `non_identity`
("Service Auth") policy on that application: an ordinary `allow` policy does
not match a service token and silently falls through to interactive IdP login,
which a headless caller cannot complete.

The Worker also validates the injected JWT independently: it fetches the
bounded key set from the configured team domain, matches one RS256 signing key
by `kid`, verifies the signature with WebCrypto, and binds issuer, single
audience, token type, and time window. It then binds the identity to exactly
one principal — for the operator, the JWT email, the injected email header, and
the configured digest; for a service token, `common_name` against the
configured client ID, requiring the email claim to be absent. A service-token
assertion omits `nbf` and `email` and carries `aud` as a bare string rather
than an array; all three are accepted shapes, and `aud` is still compared for
exact equality, never containment. An unprotected route still cannot forge any
of those claims.

Never put Worker binding values in a checked-in file, `control-plane/.env*`,
`control-plane/.dev.vars*`, a provider process, Dark Factory state, shell
history, or the macOS Keychain. Cloudflare secret values belong only in the
platform secret binding. The sole local CLI exception is the account/zone-
scoped `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` plus `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in the ignored,
mode-`0600` root `.env.txt`, used only through
`../scripts/with-cloudflare-env.sh dns status`, or
`../scripts/with-cloudflare-env.sh dns publish-app` for an explicitly
authorized command. The public launcher replaces itself with an explicit empty
environment before any setup child. The compiled helper ignores every other
assignment, rejects symlinks and broad file modes, and never passes the token to
Wrangler or another child process. It captures and re-verifies one exact
commit, refuses mutable helper source or a moving `HEAD`, and compiles only an
offline Git export of that commit. Its link-time direct-invocation check is an
accidental-misuse guardrail, not authentication: a process already running as
the operator can read the operator's mode-`0600` files. Run untrusted same-UID
code under a separate OS identity or keep the credential behind a broker.
The Durable Object binding embeds resource authority without exposing a
resource credential to the Worker. See Cloudflare's [binding] and [secret]
documentation.

[secret]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/

`wrangler secret put` immediately creates and deploys a Worker version. It is
therefore not an acceptable staging command for this bootstrap. The reviewed
live runbook must use the versions API or another no-traffic staging mechanism,
prove the exact draft, and add a route only after the independent deployment
gate. Do not improvise the first live sequence from generic Wrangler examples.
Routine production deployment is the deliberate non-local exception: the fixed
Maintainer-App workflow receives its Cloudflare API token only from the
environment-scoped GitHub Actions secret. It does not use the local `.env.txt`,
Wrangler OAuth, keychain, or ambient credentials.

## Local proof

Rust is pinned to 1.88 and Node 22 or newer is required. Wrangler, `worker`,
`worker-build`, and `wasm-bindgen` are pinned because their generated
interfaces must agree. Local CI launches Wrangler only through the repository's
clean-environment wrapper, with an isolated home/temp directory and no
Cloudflare, OAuth, keychain, loader, arbitrary PATH, dotenv/dev-vars, or config
state. The release Worker is built once before that boundary; the wrapped
Wrangler dry-run and workerd fixture verify and consume the prebuilt output,
while the direct hosted deployment build wrapper still invokes the pinned
`worker-build`. Local Wrangler telemetry is disabled at the same boundary. Run:

```sh
./scripts/local-ci.sh
```

The authoritative gate performs:

1. Rust format and native all-feature Clippy;
2. the fixed inactive default tests;
3. the native SQLite replay, conflict, signature, header, body-limit, and
   policy tests;
4. production-target `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Clippy;
5. a release Worker build;
6. a non-uploading `wrangler deploy --dry-run`; and
7. a local `workerd` integration proof, including readiness, signed ping,
   exact concurrent replay, concurrent conflict, policy rejection, duplicate
   headers, the signed webhook's 64 KiB limit, persistence across runtime
   restart, absent future routes, and invalid-config inactivity. The native SQLite lane separately
   proves operation replay, conflict, state transitions, and exactly one
   concurrent effect claim. Live GitHub and Access calls are not made by CI.

The gate installs `worker-build` 0.8.5 under ignored `.tools/` and uses the
project-local locked Wrangler. It creates no `.env` file, calls no live API,
and deploys nothing.

## Activation gates

No live action is implied by merging this code. Activation requires a separate
operator-authorized run in this order:

1. local CI, release bundle, Wrangler dry-run, and independent adversarial
   `ALLOW` on one exact commit;
2. a disposable Cloudflare account or isolated Worker proof using distinct
   test bindings and no production GitHub App;
3. review of the exact no-traffic secret-staging and route/domain commands;
4. verification of the permanent `Dark Factory Maintainer` GitHub App and its
   exact webhook secret;
5. upload of one exact Worker version with required secrets while it has no
   public route;
6. configuration of a Cloudflare Access self-hosted application for the exact
   `/mcp` path, with Managed OAuth and only the configured operator identity;
7. verification of the version, Durable Object binding, Access application,
   and deployment configuration without reading secret values;
8. a route activation followed by `/healthz`, `/readyz`, signed ping, replay,
   conflict, unauthenticated MCP rejection, authenticated MCP initialization,
   and `maintainer_status`; and
9. connection of the remote MCP server to Codex/ChatGPT, followed by use of its
   typed tools for the next PR under the normal independent-review rule.

Cloudflare account credentials, GitHub App credentials, route changes, and
deployments remain operator authority. Tests and review never exercise them.

## Future integrations

This hosting choice does not turn the control plane into a generic webhook
proxy. Each future source gets an explicit verifier, bounded schema, policy,
and storage namespace. A product delivery may at most become the existing
provider-neutral quarantine envelope; it never becomes executable work by
itself.

High-volume durable receipt can later hand off to Cloudflare Queues only after
the Durable Object commit. Queues are at-least-once, so the Durable Object
identity remains the deduplication authority. Long-running typed effects may
later use Workflows, but every external GitHub mutation still needs a durable
operation key and reconciliation state for ambiguous outcomes. Those are
implemented for the first pull-request operations; each future mutation still
requires its own reviewed schema, policy, reconciliation query, and tests.
