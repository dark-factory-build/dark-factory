/// that could rewrite the CI gating its own work would be escalating its
/// authority.
///
/// The refusal is by path segment, not by prefix. A tree entry may name a
/// directory as a blob, which replaces the whole subtree, so `.github` and
/// `.github/workflows` must be refused as paths in their own right and not
/// only as prefixes of a file inside them.
///
/// The review and dependency policy files are refused by name for the same
/// reason. Refusing the `.github` tree stops an agent destroying them
/// wholesale but not rewriting one of them in place, and an agent that can
/// edit CODEOWNERS can remove itself from required review — the same
/// escalation, reached one file at a time. GitHub reads CODEOWNERS from the
/// repository root, `.github/`, and `docs/`, so all three are named.
///
/// Each of those names is also refused as a leading directory. A tree entry
/// at `.github/CODEOWNERS/x` turns the CODEOWNERS blob into a tree, deleting
/// its content as a side effect: exactly the write the by-name refusal
/// exists to prevent, reached by making the name a directory instead. The
/// collision is with the *leading* segments only, so a path that merely
/// contains a protected name -- `CODEOWNERS.md`, `docs/notes-on-CODEOWNERS.md`
/// -- stays publishable, and so does one that carries it as a whole segment
/// somewhere GitHub reads no authority from, such as `src/CODEOWNERS`.
///
/// The `.github` tree needs no such rule. It is already refused as a path in
/// its own right, so no blob can replace it, and `.github/workflows` is
/// refused at any depth by the segment test, which is that directory's
/// prefix rule. The rest of `.github` is a tree this surface deliberately
/// publishes into -- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**` and
/// `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` stay allowed -- which is why the three
/// `.github/*` entries above are refused by name one at a time. A blanket
/// prefix rule there would refuse intended writes rather than close a hole.
