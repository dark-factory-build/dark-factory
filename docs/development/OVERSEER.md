# Overseer runbook

An overseer is an agent with `--role orchestrator`. Its job is publication: it
takes what a worker finished and gets it merged, through the Maintainer App,
and asks a human only when it cannot decide alone. It never writes code.

The overseer's standing instruction (CONFIG → RULES → WHEN IDLE → run a
standing instruction) is short, because a Claude launch delivers the task
through the terminal and that prepared prompt is capped at 8 KiB:

> You are the overseer of the project named PROJECT. Run
> `git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/OWNER/REPO repo`, read
> repo/docs/development/OVERSEER.md, and follow it exactly. Before exiting,
> report the durable outcome with `$DARK_FACTORY_FACTORYCTL attempt succeed
> --result` (one line per change you handled, or "nothing to publish"), or
> with `attempt block --detail` if you raised a human request.

Every command below runs from the directory the session starts in, its
private runtime home, with the clone at `repo` inside it.

Everything below assumes that session: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, the
operator's own home and login, a private `TMPDIR`, no `gh` credential, git
without any remote credential, and the Maintainer App as the one MCP server
(`maintainer`). Nothing here needs more than that.

## What you may and may not do

- Publish only through the App: `publish_commit`, `create_issue`,
  `create_pull_request`, `enqueue_pull_request`, and the observe tools. Never
  `git push`, never edit the operator's checkout, never write into a retained
  Change.
- Never record a review verdict yourself. The review is a separate headless
  session started by `scripts/cold-review.sh`; you read its verdict.
- One change at a time, in the order the runs finished.
- A review that asks for changes is not a decision for a human: send the task
  back to its worker with the findings (`attempt send-back`, section 5) and
  the worker's next run continues from the tree it left.
- When a step needs a decision you are not sure of, or a publication is
  blocked twice, raise it with `attempt request-human` and end the run with
  `attempt block` carrying the same text (section 6). The request is the
  NEEDS YOU card on the operator's console while the run lives; the blocked
  task keeps the reason after it ends.

## 1. Find what a worker finished

The daemon home is two directories above `$DARK_FACTORY_SOCKET`. Its store is
`factory.sqlite3`; read it read-only, never write:

```sh
home=$(dirname "$(dirname "$DARK_FACTORY_SOCKET")")
sqlite3 -readonly -json "file:$home/factory.sqlite3?mode=ro" "
SELECT lower(hex(c.id)) AS change_id, lower(hex(c.base_commit)) AS base_commit,
       lower(hex(t.id)) AS task_id, t.work_revision,
       p.name AS project, p.root, t.title, t.body,
       r.terminal_result AS result, a.name AS agent
FROM changes c
JOIN runs r ON r.id = c.settled_run_id
JOIN tasks t ON t.id = c.task_id
JOIN agents a ON a.id = r.agent_id
JOIN projects p ON p.id = c.project_id
WHERE c.phase = 'retained' AND r.phase = 'terminal' AND r.terminal_kind = 'succeeded' AND r.role = 'worker'
  AND r.admitted_task_work_revision = t.work_revision
ORDER BY r.terminal_at_ms"
```

Handle only rows whose `project` is yours. The retained tree of a change is
`$home/changes/<change_id>`. The last condition keeps out a task that was
sent back and not yet retried: its change still holds the tree the review
refused. A change is finished when its `enqueue-HEAD8`
operation (step 5) for its current head is `completed` in the App journal
and the merge was observed; anything short of that is resumed at the first
step whose operation is not completed, as section 2 says. A task sent back
after a review (section 5) comes around again as the same change id at a
higher `work_revision`, with its branch and pull request already open:
section 3 publishes the new tree on top of that branch.

## 2. Derive one operation id per step, and check the journal first

Every App write takes an `operation_id`. Derive it from the change and the
step so a retry is a replay, never a second publication:

```sh
opid() { python3 -c "import sys,uuid; print(uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_URL, 'dark-factory:' + sys.argv[1] + ':' + sys.argv[2]))" "$1" "$2"; }
# opid CHANGE_ID STEP   with STEP one of:
#   issue, pr                                  once per change
#   publish-1, publish-2, ...                  the first publication, one per commit
#   publish-HEAD8-1, publish-HEAD8-2, ...      a follow-up on top of branch head HEAD8
#   review-HEAD8, review-HEAD8-2               the review of pull request head HEAD8
#   enqueue-HEAD8                              the enqueue of pull request head HEAD8
```

`HEAD8` is the first eight hex digits of the commit named, so a follow-up
commit, its review and its enqueue each get ids of their own.

One id per App write: a change that needs several commits (step 3) uses
`publish-1`, `publish-2` and so on, one per commit, and the same request under
the same id is a replay while a different request under it is refused. Before
each write call `observe_operation` with its id. `completed` means that write
already happened: take its result (for a commit, the head it returned) and go
on to the next step, which for a multi-commit publication is the next commit,
not the pull request. Never received or `planned` means it has not happened.
`executing` or `indeterminate` means stop and raise a human request with the
id.

## 3. Publish the change as a branch

The branch is `factory/<first 12 hex of change_id>`. The task's
`work_revision` from section 1 says which publication this is:

- `1`: the first publication. The commit goes on top of `base_commit`, under
  `publish-1`, `publish-2`, and so on. If the branch already exists, an
  earlier run of yours stopped partway: resume at the first `publish-N` the
  journal lacks (its `expected_head_sha` is the head the last completed one
  returned), then at the issue and the pull request, as section 2 says.
- above `1`: the task was sent back and the worker continued from the tree it
  left. `observe_ref` for the branch; it exists, at `branch_head`, and the
  commit goes on top of it under `publish-<HEAD8 of branch_head>-1`, with the
  diff against that head, not the base. A branch that does not exist here
  means the earlier publication never happened: treat it as the first.

Set `from` to `base_commit` or `branch_head` accordingly.

Compute the diff against `from` without a checkout: the clone's object
store, its index filled from `from`, and the retained tree as the work tree.
`git add -A` respects the tree's own `.gitignore`, so build output the
worker left behind is not published.

```sh
export GIT_DIR=$PWD/repo/.git GIT_WORK_TREE=$home/changes/$change_id GIT_INDEX_FILE=$PWD/change.index
git fetch -q origin "$from"
git read-tree "$from" && git add -A
git diff --cached --no-renames --name-status "$from" > changed.txt   # A / M / D per path, never R
git diff --cached --no-renames --numstat "$from"                     # for the delta paragraph
git ls-files --stage                                                 # mode and blob per path
unset GIT_DIR GIT_WORK_TREE GIT_INDEX_FILE
```

`--no-renames` matters: a rename would otherwise arrive as one `R` line
with two paths, and the old path's deletion would never reach the App.

Prepare the entries once, into a file, rather than pasting base64 into the
call by hand:

```sh
tree=$home/changes/$change_id
python3 - "$tree" changed.txt > entries.json <<'PY'
import base64, json, os, sys
tree, listing = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
entries = []
for line in open(listing):                     # changed.txt from above
    status, path = line.rstrip('\n').split('\t', 1)
    if status == 'D':
        entries.append({'path': path})
        continue
    full = os.path.join(tree, path)
    mode = '100755' if os.access(full, os.X_OK) else '100644'
    entries.append({'path': path, 'mode': mode, 'content_base64': base64.b64encode(open(full, 'rb').read()).decode()})
json.dump(entries, sys.stdout)
PY
```

Build the `changes` array for `publish_commit`: added and modified paths carry
`content_base64` and the `mode` the staged entry shows (`100644` or
`100755`); deleted paths carry only `path`. The App takes at most 50 entries
per commit and 1,000,000 base64 characters per file (about 732 KiB of
content), and refuses the `.github` directory itself, `.github/workflows`,
the CODEOWNERS locations and the dependabot config (other `.github` paths
are publishable). More than 50 files means several commits on the same
branch, each bound to the head the previous one returned. A file over that
bound, a symlink (staged mode `120000`), or a refused path is a human request,
not a workaround.

Then, with `branch = factory/<first 12 hex of change_id>`:

1. `observe_ref` for `main` and keep the answer as `main_head`. If it is not
   `base_commit`, main moved since the worker started; publish anyway from
   `from` and let the queue merge it, but say so in the body.
2. `publish_commit` with `branch`, `expected_head_sha = from`, `message` =
   the task title and nothing else (the App takes exactly one line: no blank
   line, no trailers, no session link; a second line is refused as
   `invalid_input`), and the first (or only) 50 entries. The operation id is
   `opid "$change_id" publish-1` for a first publication and
   `opid "$change_id" publish-<HEAD8 of from>-1` for a follow-up. It returns
   the new head commit; a second commit uses the next number and that head,
   and so on. The last returned head is the pull request head.

## 4. Open the issue and the pull request

A follow-up publication (`work_revision` above 1 with the branch present)
already has both: the journal shows `issue` and `pr` completed, and the
pull request number is in the `pr` operation's result. Do not create
either again. Still write the body file the review reads, from the public
API, which needs no credential:

```sh
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/$PR" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["body"])' > body.md
```

followed by a paragraph headed by the new head that says what this commit
changes against the previous head, from the diff you just computed. A
resumed first publication whose `pr` is completed but whose `body.md` is
not in this run's directory takes its body the same way. Then go to the
review.

`create_pull_request` needs an issue. `create_issue` with `opid "$change_id" issue`, the
task title (cut to 256 characters, the App's bound), and a body of the task
text plus the change id; it returns the issue number. Then read
`observe_ref` for `main` again, immediately before the call, and use that
answer: `create_pull_request` with `opid "$change_id" pr`, `issue_number` from that
result, `head = branch`, `head_sha` = the last published commit, `base =
main`, `base_sha` = main's head as just read (the App verifies the base
branch is at that commit at that moment; `base_commit` is wrong whenever
main moved, and a stale read is wrong whenever main moves between the read
and the call), `draft = false`, the same title, and a body in this
repository's shape. An operation
id belongs to the exact request it was first sent with, so a request the App
refuses for its content cannot be corrected under the same id: that is a
human request, not a retry.

- What changed and why: from the task and the diff, in prose.
- Production-line delta: added minus deleted outside tests, docs and fixtures,
  from the numstat, with the largest files named.
- How it was verified: what the worker's result text says it ran, and that
  the merge queue runs `scripts/local-ci.sh`. Claim nothing you did not see.
- Never an email, an org name, an account id, or a `/Users/<name>` path.
- End with the repository's generated-with line and nothing after it. You
  have no session link; never invent one.

Write that body to a file; the review needs it.

## 5. Get the cold review, then merge

```sh
DARK_FACTORY_REVIEW_OPERATION_ID=$(opid "$change_id" "review-$(printf '%s' "$HEAD_SHA" | cut -c1-8)") \
    repo/scripts/cold-review.sh OWNER/REPO PR HEAD_SHA "$base_commit" body.md "first review"
```

The fourth argument is the change's `base_commit`, the commit the branch was
published from, never main's live head: the reviewer's diff runs from the
merge base of that commit and the pull request head, and its rules are that
commit's `AGENTS.md`.

The verdict is recorded under that operation id, so `observe_operation`
with it answers `completed` with the verdict (`allow` or `block`) once a
review exists, and nothing until then. The script exits 0 for ALLOW, 1 for
REQUEST_CHANGES, 3 when the session reported no verdict, 4 when the pull
request is no longer at that head, 2 for an argument or a tool it refuses,
and 5 when it could not prepare the checkout, and leaves
`review-PR-HEAD8.log` in the current directory.

- Exit 3: run it once more; a second 3 is a human request with the log's
  last lines.
- ALLOW: `enqueue_pull_request` with `opid "$change_id" enqueue-HEAD8`, the PR number, the head
  and `base = main`. Then `observe_pull_request_merge`, with the PR number,
  the head, `base = main` and the enqueue operation id, every 60 s for up to
  30 minutes;
  never faster. Merged: done. Still queued after 30 minutes: the change is
  not finished; raise a human request naming the PR and stop, and the next
  run observes it again. No longer queued and not merged:
  the queue's run failed or dropped the entry, and the App cannot read a
  queue run's log or rerun it (`read_pull_request_job_log` and
  `rerun_failed_pull_request_jobs` bind to the pull request's own runs), so
  raise a human request with the PR link; never enqueue again on your own.
  An ALLOW the App did not record shows up the same way: the queue's review
  check refuses the entry.
- REQUEST_CHANGES: you do not fix code. Send the task back to its worker
  with a note that names the pull request and tells the worker how to read
  the findings; the findings themselves live on the pull request's reviews,
  which the worker can fetch without a credential, so the note needs only
  the pull request number and head:

  ```sh
  note="Pull request https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/$PR (head $HEAD_SHA) was blocked by its cold review with must-change findings. Read them with: curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews | python3 -c 'import json,sys; [print(r[\"body\"]) for r in json.load(sys.stdin)]' and fix each in the tree you left; the pull request stays open."
  "$DARK_FACTORY_FACTORYCTL" attempt send-back --task "$task_id" --note "$note"
  ```

  The note is appended to the task's body, which the worker's provider
  receives whole; the daemon refuses a send-back the provider could not be
  handed (`too_large`), so keep the note to that shape: a pointer, never the
  findings pasted. A shell agent's task is a program and cannot be sent
  back at all (`invalid_request`); that is a human request. A `too_large` even so means the task's own body is at
  the provider's bound and no note fits: raise a human request naming the
  pull request and the task, and end the run with `attempt block`, since the
  change would otherwise come around again to the same refusal. The task is queued again and the worker's next run
  continues from the retained tree; a later run of yours finds the same
  change id at the next work revision and publishes the new tree on top of
  the branch (section 3). Stop handling this change for now.
- Exit 4: the pull request is no longer at the head you published, which
  only a person can have done; raise a human request.
- Exit 2 or 5: the script refused its arguments or could not prepare the
  checkout; the log was not written. Check the head and base you passed once,
  then raise a human request with the script's message.

On a resumed run, a change whose `pr` is completed but whose `enqueue-HEAD8`
for the current head is not needs no second review if one was recorded:
`observe_operation` with `opid "$change_id"
review-HEAD8` for the pull request head answers `completed` with verdict
`allow` (enqueue), `block` (blocked: send the task back with the note
above, which needs only the pull request and its head, if the task is not
already queued at the next work revision, then stop), `note`
(a comment that decided nothing: run the review again under a fresh id, the
head's plus `-2`), or nothing (run the review); `executing` or
`indeterminate` is a human request, as in section 2. The `review` check
itself runs only in the merge queue, so it is never the signal here.

## 6. Hand off and finish

If a merged PR touched `cmd/` or `internal/`, the live service needs a
reinstall, and if it touched `web/`, the site needs a re-vendor; raise one
human request naming the merge commit and which of the two applies. A
worker run whose tree the daemon refused ends failed with the reason and
leaves the tree at `$home/changes/<change_id>.refused-<run8>` for a person
to read and remove; it is never yours to publish. Then report, one line
per change: change id, PR number, and merged commit or the reason it
stopped.

```sh
"$DARK_FACTORY_FACTORYCTL" attempt request-human --idempotency-key "$(uuidgen | tr -d - | tr A-F a-f)" --question "..."
"$DARK_FACTORY_FACTORYCTL" attempt block --detail "..."      # when a human request was raised
"$DARK_FACTORY_FACTORYCTL" attempt succeed --result "..."    # otherwise
```

A request-human does not wait for the answer, and the request goes stale
the moment the run ends, so a run that raised one ends with `attempt block`
carrying the same text (cut to 4 KiB, the detail's bound; the question
allows 8 KiB): the blocked task keeps the reason on the console until a
person sends it back or queues a new instruction. A run that raised
none ends with `attempt succeed`. The next standing-instruction run picks
up where the journal says you stopped.
