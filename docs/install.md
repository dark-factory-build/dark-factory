# Installation

The same three sibling binaries can come from a published macOS release or a
source build. The [development workflow](development/WORKFLOW.md) documents a
temporary `DARK_FACTORY_HOME` and explicit socket for isolated checks.

## Install a release

The release provides one archive for each supported macOS target:

- Apple silicon: `dark-factory-vX.Y.Z-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Intel: `dark-factory-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`

Download the matching archive from the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/dark-factory-build/dark-factory/releases),
verify its entry in that release's `SHA256SUMS`, and put `factoryd`,
`factory-runner`, and `factoryctl` from the archive together on `PATH`. The
release's Homebrew formula installs the same commands if it has been added to a
tap.

Create and install one managed home. Installation loads the launchd job;
`service start` is the explicit command to use after a later stop:

```sh
factoryctl init --home "$HOME/.dark-factory"
factoryctl service install --home "$HOME/.dark-factory"
factoryctl service status --home "$HOME/.dark-factory"
```

To upgrade a running installation to a new build, run `factoryctl service
uninstall --home "$HOME/.dark-factory"` with the new `factoryctl`, then
`factoryctl service install --home "$HOME/.dark-factory"`. Only the service's
binaries, plist, and receipt are replaced; the data home is untouched. An
installation that used `--relay-origin` must repeat that flag on the install
after the uninstall, or the new job comes back loopback-only.

To reach the factory from the hosted PWA rather than only from this machine's
loopback, install with `factoryctl service install --home "$HOME/.dark-factory"
--relay-origin wss://relay.darkfactory.build`. The flag is optional and has no
default: omitting it installs a loopback-only job exactly as before. The
installed launchd job then starts `factoryd` with that `--relay-origin`, and the
service receipt records the exact argument list it was rendered from, so
`service status` and `service uninstall` reproduce that exact plist from the
receipt and keep proving ownership. Changing or removing the relay origin is
`factoryctl service uninstall` followed by a fresh install carrying the origin
you want: repeating an install with a different origin refuses, printing the
origin already installed, rather than silently keeping or dropping it. Pair a
phone with `factoryctl remote pair`.

Point the operator client at that home and open the paired hosted console:

```sh
export DARK_FACTORY_SOCKET="$HOME/.dark-factory/runtimes/factory.sock"
export DARK_FACTORY_OPERATOR_TOKEN_FILE="$HOME/.dark-factory/operator.token"
factoryctl web status
factoryctl web open
```

Alternatively, open <http://127.0.0.1:43123/pair> in a browser on this machine
and confirm; the daemon serves that one first-party page and nothing else.
`web open` or the pair page also replaces a saved browser credential that this
daemon no longer accepts. To inspect or revoke daemon-side browser clients
explicitly, use `factoryctl web list-clients` and `factoryctl web revoke
CLIENT_ID --revision REVISION`. The CLI cannot delete origin-scoped browser
storage; a normal fresh `web open` makes that manual browser action
unnecessary.

Create each agent with an explicit provider. `shell` needs no external tool;
`claude_code` and `codex` require the corresponding `claude` or `codex` CLI to
be installed and already signed in through its normal account workflow:

```sh
factoryctl agent create --project PROJECT_ID --name worker --provider shell --tool-budget 100
factoryctl agent create --project PROJECT_ID --name worker --provider claude_code --reasoning-effort medium --tool-budget 100
```

The managed daemon finds native tools on its fixed path and reuses the
operator's existing signed-in Claude or Codex account without copying a
credential into the Dark Factory home. See the [provider
contract](providers.md) for discovery, model, effort, and task-delivery details.

`factoryctl service stop` stops the managed daemon without removing the
installation; restart it with `factoryctl service start --home
"$HOME/.dark-factory"`. `factoryctl service uninstall` is the evidence-first
removal path for that exact home and label. Homebrew does not own the running
service; do not use `brew services` for Dark Factory.
