#
# One independent adversarial cold review of a pull request at one exact head,
# recorded through the Maintainer App by a fresh headless Codex session that
# has not seen the work. `DARK_FACTORY_REVIEW_PROVIDER=claude` keeps the
# existing Claude path available. Needs git, the selected provider and the App
# bridge on PATH and no GitHub credential: the head is fetched from the public
# repository by its pull request ref, the base must be a commit that fetch
# brought along, and the body is the file the caller wrote. When set,
# DARK_FACTORY_REVIEW_EVIDENCE_FILE names a JSON gate receipt (head, base, integer exit_code: 0) copied
# into the read-only review directory; it adds no tools or permissions and
# does not replace gates.
#
# DARK_FACTORY_REVIEW_OPERATION_ID, when set, is the App operation id the
# verdict is recorded under, so a caller that derives it can read the verdict
# back with observe_operation; otherwise uuidgen mints one, so uuidgen is
# only needed when it is not set.
#
# Exit status: 0 when the session reports an ALLOW verdict, 1 for
# REQUEST_CHANGES, 3 when it reports no verdict at all, 4 when the pull
# request is no longer at the stated head, 2 for bad arguments, a malformed
# operation id, a missing tool, a base commit the repository does not hold
# or shares no history with the head, or a base that already contains the
# head, 5 when the clone, the checkout, the renaming below (including a
# change that already holds a path the rename would take, since mv into an
# existing directory succeeds and leaves the instruction live), the rules
# copy or the session log fails. The session's final
# message lands in review-PR-HEAD8.log in the current directory. Whether a
# verdict was really recorded is the merge queue's review check to decide,
# not this script's.
#
# The diff the reviewer reads runs from the merge base of BASE_SHA and the
# head, so a base that has moved on since the branch started shows only the
# change. Every CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, AGENTS.md and .claude in the
# checkout, at any depth and in any spelling of case (a case-insensitive
# filesystem serves them all), is renamed with an .under-review suffix. The
# reviewer reads them by their renamed paths as content and judges the change
# against the merge base's AGENTS.md, written beside the body as rules.md.
