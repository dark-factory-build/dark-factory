# ruleset: "main-protect" (no bypass for anyone, not even the admin) makes
# the aggregate `required` run (hosted macOS + Ubuntu), linear history, and no
# force-push/deletion
# unconditional; "main-review" carries the pull-request rule with a
# Repository-admin (id 5) bypass in pull-request mode, since GitHub never
# lets an author approve their own PR and this repository has one
# maintainer. Everyone else needs the PR, an owner approval on any owned path,
# resolved threads, and a green `required` aggregate from GitHub Actions
# (integration 15368). Currency is the merge queue's job, not a strict
# up-to-date check. Nobody pushes to main.

# The condition names `refs/heads/main` rather than `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`, and that
# is load-bearing: GitHub refuses a merge queue rule whose ref condition is not
# an exact name ("Wildcard ref names are not supported when merge queue is
# enabled"), and it counts `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` as non-exact. On the real ruleset
# that refusal arrives as `Invalid rule 'merge_queue': ` with an empty reason,
# so the cause is only visible if you happen to try a wildcard and read the
# better error. Renaming the default branch now needs this line changed too.
#
# A merge queue also requires an ORGANIZATION-owned repository. The same rule
# with the same parameters is rejected on a user-owned repository, again with
# an empty reason. That is why this repository moved to `dark-factory-build`.
#
# `strict_required_status_checks_policy` is deliberately FALSE, and the merge
# queue is why. Strict demands every open pull request be rebased onto main and
# fully re-tested after any merge, so with more than one branch in flight each
# merge invalidates the next: update-branch, wait a full CI run, merge, repeat.
# The queue gives the same guarantee without the serialisation — it tests
# main + everything ahead in the queue + this entry, and merges only that exact
# combination — so strict would add a per-merge re-run for a property the queue
# already establishes. GitHub also expects strict off when a queue is enabled.

# `required_approving_review_count` is 0 and `require_code_owner_review` is
# true, which is not "no review". It moves the requirement from "every pull
# request needs an approval" to "every pull request touching an owned path
# needs the owner's approval", and `.github/CODEOWNERS` decides which paths
# those are: everything executable, everything that gates or deploys, and
# everything that defines authority. A documentation-only change merges on its
# checks; a change under `crates/`, `control-plane/`, `.github/`, `scripts/`,
# or to the agent rules still stops for a human.
#
# The reason to spend the count this way is that the owner is also the author
# of most pull requests here, and GitHub never lets an author approve their
# own. A blanket count of 1 therefore made every owner-authored change merge
# by admin bypass — a gate satisfied by circumventing it rather than by
# meeting it. Scoping by path means the approvals that do happen are real.
