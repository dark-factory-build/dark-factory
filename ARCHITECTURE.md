# Architecture

Dark Factory separates model policy from durable work authority. This file
describes the current Go runtime's attempt kernel, daemon-owned Change model,
and fail-closed process boundary. It is a contract, not a component catalogue.

## Durable model

`RunId` is the attempt identity. A task can be queued without a run; a run
exists only after admission.

```text
Task: queued --------> running ----------------------> terminal result
                         |
                         v
Run:  admitted -> running -> finalizing -> terminal
          |          |           |
          |          |           +-- immutable outcome request, no authority
          |          +-- exact attempt bearer authorizes bounded effects
          +-- child may be prepared but cannot exec

Send-back: terminal result -> queued at the next work revision, the note replacing an earlier one

Assignment: one agent, or none (any eligible worker) -> claimed by the admitting worker, kept through send-back unless reassigned

Resource: declared -> active -> releasing -> released
                                      \----> unresolved
```

The run outcome is distinct from its phase: succeeded, blocked with a reason,
failed with a typed reason, or cancelled with a reason. The first durable move
to `finalizing` freezes its requested outcome. Later completion, block, cancel,
or exit observations are idempotent and cannot replace that request. The one
replacement is the daemon's refusal of a worker's published tree at
settlement, which becomes the run's outcome in place of what the worker
proposed, with the reason.

Only the finalizer writes `terminal`. It may do so only when every ephemeral
resource is released and every retained artifact is durably transferred to its
next owner. Cleanup failure leaves the run visibly `finalizing`; it never
pretends that a resource disappeared. The current daemon accepts only
`VerificationNone`; non-None verification policies are rejected as
unsupported before a provider runs.

## Authority invariants

1. SQLite is the sole durable authority. State mutations and their bounded
   events commit together. Process-local locks serialize work but never prove
   ownership.
2. Every attempt mutation requires one bearer credential for one
   exact `running` run. Authentication derives project, agent, task, run, role,
   provider, and Change scope from the store.
3. Anonymous local requests may ask only for health. Operator requests require
   the private operator credential. Attempt credentials are valid only while
   the exact run is `running`; admission, `finalizing`, and `terminal` grant no
   effect authority. Operator authentication cannot impersonate an attempt.
4. Admission is one global `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` Store transaction. It validates
   the fresh schema image and one SQL integrity predicate before reconciliation,
   capacity, or selection. No caller supplies an agent, task, observation, or
   cursor. Corrupt durable control is corruption, never queue ineligibility.
   Capacity counts admitted, running, and finalizing worker runs together.
   One additional factory-wide orchestrator slot keeps supervision available.
   Role capacity participates in task selection, so a blocked role cannot hide
   eligible work in the other. Dispatch still gates all new admission.
5. The Store selects the canonical eligible task and agent globally by priority
   descending, creation time ascending, and exact 16-byte task-ID BLOB bytes
   ascending. A queued task names one agent or none; an unassigned task is a
   candidate for every unarchived, unpaused worker in its project. Each agent's
   candidate is its replacement, then its own assigned work, then shared work,
   and the global choice keeps the canonical order. Admission writes the chosen
   agent into a shared task in the same transaction, so a claim is exclusive
   and durable and survives send-back until an explicit reassignment.
   It validates the selected Change and binds the task incarnation,
   revision, provider, and launch facts before external effects. Repository or
   provider availability becomes typed post-admission failure, never a stale
   scheduler filter.
6. `dispatch_enabled` controls only new admission. An admitted run retains its
   provider, optional model, and optional reasoning effort. Native providers retain operator account authority, while Codex local commands
   use a launch-derived filesystem profile. No permission-profile field is
   persisted or supplied by a task.
7. No admitted attempt means no provider process or outcome request, and no
   writable source lease. A retry creates a new run and bearer; it never revives
   an old process or credential.

## Browser authority

The paired browser is a client of the local API, not a second scheduler. It
may submit a bounded instruction to a ready agent or queue later work while it
is busy or paused. The daemon creates the same durable task used by `factoryctl`.
No provider process is created until admission starts a run. Raw terminal input
remains opaque; explicit message/interrupt controls reserve durable receipts
before a PTY write. An uncertain receipt is never written again. Stop/replacement
commits its receipt, optional successor and run finalization atomically.

An orchestrator's attempt credential also grants project-scoped supervision
commands. Every control revalidates its live authority and target inside the
mutation transaction. Worker invalidations trigger bounded standing tasks for
the overseer. Its durable sequence cursor advances with enqueue; events arriving
while it is busy stay pending. Cursor lag behind the retained journal wakes a
conservative inspection. No model runs merely to poll an idle project.

## Browser state

The browser reads one bounded, transactionally pinned active-state snapshot
and is told only that the durable head moved. A client holds one coherent
snapshot or none; a change notification carries only a head. Tasks include
queued/running work, unresolved request origins, and the most recent completion
per agent so terminal settlement remains visible. Every task item names its
agent; queued work no worker has claimed yet is served in the additive
`shared_tasks` member, which a console built before the shared queue ignores
while a current console folds it into the same task view. The additive
`peer_questions` member lists the newest questions between queued or running
tasks (who asked whom, and whether it was answered; never the words, which stay
behind task detail), so the floor can show them passing. The console groups queues
by agent; within each queue, the priority/creation-time/ID ordering matches
admission, including an explicit replacement ahead of that agent's queued
work. These groups do not predict the global order of starts across agents.

Completed history is a separate private read: `TASK_LIST_GET` returns at most
ten public task summaries for one agent, newest first, with a total count.
Each page is transactionally pinned; its last update time and ID form a keyset
cursor unaffected by unrelated events. A refresh retrieves newer completions;
no history is deleted or silently folded into the active-state bound. Task
text and intervention history still require their existing private reads.

The snapshot read runs in a single pinned SQLite transaction and selects only
public columns plus a bounded excerpt of a blocked task's reason, so a
concurrent writer cannot produce a mixed head and other private durable data is
never loaded. A watcher registers before rereading the durable
head, so a commit landing between a client's snapshot and its registration is
announced immediately rather than waiting for the next poll.

Bounds are exact and fail closed. Client-to-server control stays at 64 KiB;
only a server snapshot may reach 1 MiB, and the kernel refuses to project more
than 4,096 entities. Neither bound truncates: active state that does not fit is one finite
`too_large` answer, never a partial view. Accumulated completed history does
not count against this active-state limit.

The wire contract is unversioned and tolerates additive change. There is no
envelope generation, no versioned loopback path, no version in the pairing and
auth transcript domains, and no protocol identity in the published artifacts;
the loopback path is `/browser`, and `/pair` beside it is the one HTML page
the daemon serves: a script-free confirm page whose form mints a pairing
challenge and redirects to the hosted console. A control frame carrying a
member this build does not know is served, so the hosted console and the
daemon tolerate additive members in either installation order. New message
types still require daemon support; deploy that support before a console
that uses them.

An ignored member is an ASCII name that is not a known name under any case. A
non-ASCII name is refused outright, and a member differing from a known one
only in case is refused, not ignored: Go matches struct fields with Unicode
case folding, so tolerating either would let it overwrite the exact member the
shape check validated while a TypeScript peer,
whose keys are exact, kept reading the exact one. Both decoders refuse it, so
both read the same frame the same way.

Tolerance is additive only. Every size, count, depth and member bound still
binds, and an unknown member counts toward them: an array or a nesting depth
inside a tolerated member is measured exactly as one inside a known member. A
missing required member, a member of the wrong type and a frame arriving in the
wrong direction remain finite refusals that end the connection. A client
control type the daemon does not know is answered by its request id with
`ERROR` code `unsupported` and the daemon keeps its side open, so a console
that knows that code degrades one feature instead of losing its session. The
other direction is still closed: the console decoder ends the session on a
server frame type or an `ERROR` code it does not know (#556).

## Browser HumanRequest authority

The Go runtime keeps HumanRequest authority in SQLite and exposes only bounded,
correlated browser operations. Public HumanRequest state contains request,
project, agent and task relationships, chronology, revision, kind, status, the
fixed reply bound, and display-only `can_reply`. It contains no run locator,
terminal locator, question, reply, cancel descriptor, process identity, or
other private source data.

Closing the selected agent's current-run terminal detaches that observer while
leaving the authenticated BrowserSession connected; only an ambiguous detach
fails closed by stopping the session.

Private detail is one pinned SQLite read. A client with
`private_human_request_detail` may receive the exact hostile question and, only
for an open request whose originating run is running with its exact active
terminal session, an observation-only terminal target. Before minting that
target, the same snapshot validates the canonical task assignment, resource
topology and identities, run/resource/session chronology, and requires the
validated terminal session to equal the selected active session.
`human_actions` is checked independently: without it, detail may contain that
target but cannot advertise reply or cancellation. With it, the same snapshot
may mint the one concrete cancellation descriptor containing exact request and
run revisions. Delivering, delivery-unknown, finalizing, terminal, missing, and
non-active origins expose no reply or cancellation authority; corrupt active
relationships fail closed rather than resembling unavailability.
`administration` is the operator's own bit: discovering and linking this
machine's provider logins and choosing which one an agent runs as. A pairing
minted on loopback carries it; a relay pairing does not.

A reply contains only request ID, expected request revision, and bounded text.
The Store derives the originating run and commits a unique delivery receipt
before the daemon looks up that exact live owner or writes once to its PTY.
Failure or uncertainty after reservation becomes `delivery_unknown` and is
never replayed. Cancellation likewise derives the origin, checks exact
revisions and capability, enters finalizing, revokes authority, resolves the
request, and appends invalidations in one Store transaction. The exact live
attempt then fences its current terminal binding; rejected, partial, uncertain,
or controller-failed fencing is visible after commit and is never retried
against another run.

## Process and resource ownership

The Go runtime launches one fresh runner-owned interactive PTY per run with
explicit authenticated attach/input authority. No provider process is reused
across runs.

Launch is one nested register-before-exec handshake:

1. `factoryd` records the admitted run and a random runtime claim. The
   claim-derived path is durable before `mkdir`; its inode replaces the claim
   before a process is created inside it.
2. `factoryd` creates and locks a private startup file, persists its exact
   filesystem identity, then maps that lock to the inert runner gate's stdin.
3. `factoryd` persists the inert gate's stable PID before activating it into
   `factory-runner`.
4. The runner prepares a second child blocked before provider `exec` and reports
   the stable provider PID and process group.
5. `factoryd` persists those identities, moves the run to `running`, and only
   then releases the child to provider `exec`.

If preparation or activation fails, the run enters `finalizing`; a provider
must never execute first and become durable later. The runner is a
provider-blind effect host, not a second lifecycle owner.

A released runner publishes a private takeover endpoint in its own runtime
directory: a one-shot bearer in `takeover.json` and `takeover.sock`. On
shutdown the daemon asks its released, terminal-ready runner to quiesce that
control connection, makes no durable mutation, and leaves the run `running`
with every resource active and the outer child reparented. The next daemon's
recovery sweep finds that busy runtime, presents the on-disk grant, and adopts
the runner as an ordinary live attempt; the endpoint rotates its bearer on
every accepted takeover, so one grant admits one replacement. Unclaimed, the
runner converges the provider itself after a bounded grace. A compatible
upgrade therefore adopts running runners instead of draining them; a runner
with no endpoint is drained exactly as before, and a killed runner's endpoint
files are ordinary runtime residue the recovery sweep removes.

A successful attempt outcome commits `finalizing` together with one in-memory
response fence. The daemon sends a fresh random receipt after the outcome
response; the attempt client validates the reply, echoes that receipt on the
same connection, and then half-closes. Only that acknowledgement (or a visible
transport failure) clears the fence and lets the live owner terminate the
provider group. Socket I/O never holds the global operation gate, and explicit
daemon cancellation preempts a missing receipt.

Owned failed attempts apply exact recovery before `RunNext` returns. The
scheduler reports any remaining `finalizing` residue as unsettled and leaves it
for the startup recovery sweep.

The resource ledger records process, process group, runner, runtime root, and
other external effects before use. Stored numeric identities never grant
signal authority. The daemon requests shutdown through the authenticated live
runner; the runner may signal its provider group only while it owns the
unreaped leader child. After leader or runner loss, the finalizer only observes
exact absence. Reused or weak identities remain unresolved and cannot authorize
signalling, removal, or terminalization.

Provider cleanup authority ends at that owned process group. A provider that
detaches a child into another group has no supported cleanup path: neither a
descendant census nor a stored PID/birth observation can grant a direct signal
right. Providers must retain command children in the runner-owned group or
offer an authenticated, provider-owned shutdown capability before such cleanup
can be supported.

## Provider boundary

`internal/provider.Build(Request) (Launch, error)` is the one closed provider
selection boundary. It returns only one exact absolute executable, ordered argv,
and complete ordered environment. The runner owns the descriptor-bound Change
cwd, task delivery, PTY, process group, wait/reap, output, and cleanup. A
provider cannot select a source path or lifecycle result.

Shell receives bounded task bytes through a sealed descriptor. Claude Code and
Codex resolve their named CLI through the daemon's fixed tool path to one exact
direct executable commitment. Claude receives its task text once through the PTY
before the terminal is exposed, and the keystroke that submits it just after. Codex receives only a fixed non-secret startup
instruction in argv, then reads its exact task through the running attempt's
authenticated local API; task text never enters its argv, environment, or
Change-worker configuration. Native tools use the operator's existing account:
Claude uses the account `HOME`, while Codex uses its explicit configuration root
with a private runtime `HOME`. Both keep a private `TMPDIR`. [The provider
contract](docs/providers.md) owns the exact argv, environment, and task-delivery
details. The schema and wire contract contain no permission-profile field.

Provider output is opaque and never lifecycle authority.

## Change and repository ownership

`factoryd` is the only product creator and administrator of Changes. Admission
reserves one daemon-derived path for one task incarnation. A registered wrapper
makes that path an ordinary linked Git worktree of the project repository,
checked out at one exact selected commit on the Change's own branch,
`factory/<first 12 hex of the Change ID>`, before the provider can execute.
The provider works in that worktree: it edits, tests and commits there with
the factory's fixed Git identity. Each new worker has self-contained private
Git administration under `.git/dark-factory-changes/<Change ID>/.git`, using
native bare Git initialization, an exact-base fetch, and a linked worktree.
Ordinary Git commands in that worktree update its private refs, objects and
index, not the project's shared administration. Provider permissions are
unchanged; this prevents accidental shared-Git interference, not arbitrary
filesystem writes. Orchestrators read project Git administration.
The provider environment carries no Git credential helper, SSH command or
prompt. An orchestrator run binds no Change: it
works in its private runtime home, and publication of a worker's retained
Change is the Maintainer App's, reached through the one MCP server an
orchestrator's session is given, from the Change's branch and head. Factoryd
exposes no repository status, commit, push, pull-request, or publication
operation of its own.

A customer home's installed `factoryctl attempt maintainer-mcp` adapter forwards
one bounded JSON-RPC request through the attempt API. The daemon requires a live
orchestrator, limits targets and issue sources to that attempt's project, and
joins immutable numeric repository IDs against live broker grants before
forwarding. The opaque connection credential remains in the private host store;
the broker retains all GitHub tokens and repeats authorization on every call.
An operator explicitly binds each publication checkout's configured origin to
a live delegated numeric ID. Provider calls cannot learn or replace that binding.
First connection refuses while any legacy overseer is nonterminal, including
admissions not yet in the live registry. Disconnect permanently preserves customer
mode, so later launches cannot fall back to the owner's external legacy bridge.

Repository registration checks the actual Git root and local base, then pins
the root and Git administration file identities plus a digest of origin
settings. Fresh launches recheck that proof before source selection or fetch;
a replacement checkout or changed publication target cannot inherit the route.
Legacy registrations receive one proof on their first fresh launch, constrained
by retained Change and content root identities. Origin URLs and credentials are
not stored. The recorded GitHub name is configuration, not live authorization
or a verified numeric repository ID.

The durable record of a Change is its base commit, the repository identity
and, once the worktree exists, its branch head: the base when the worktree is
made, the branch tip the daemon reads at settlement afterwards. That head is
the exact head an overseer or reviewer is handed and the mutation fence a
retry and a source request check before reopening or reading the worktree.
Retries reuse a retained Change only after the preceding run is terminal, and
reopen the same worktree with the worker's commits and uncommitted edits as
it left them. A worktree the worker destroyed cannot be retained: that run
fails visibly, the Change is abandoned, and the task's retry makes a fresh
worktree on the same branch.

Fresh selection pins the exact repository root, Git administration directory,
bounded local config, object-directory root, and trusted Git executable around
each metadata process. Fresh selection refreshes a configured remote upstream
without moving the checkout; a fetch failure cannot reuse cached source. Local
revision policies and retained Changes do not fetch. Trusted Git resolves the
revision once, and `git worktree add` checks out that exact commit. A
concurrent attempt in the same repository contends only for Git's own locks.

Retained linked worktrees keep their existing administration, including on
retry: no automatic conversion rewrites their Gitfiles, indexes or refs.
Legacy canonical worktrees therefore do not have independent Git state.
Settlement and source receipts report the actual Git directory for either
layout; publication fetches that exact head without a canonical-ref import.

Changes made before managed worktrees are Git-free copies of their base with
the worker's edits in them. They stay readable, reviewable and resumable: the
first reopen or source request after the upgrade adopts such a tree into a
worktree at its recorded base, with every file untouched, so the edits become
the branch's uncommitted work and the head is recorded as a fact of the same
Change revision. No Change is reset and no history is rewritten.

## Verification and storage

The current daemon has no generic build API or completion verifier. Project
creation uses `VerificationNone`; non-None verification values are
schema-recognized but rejected by the supervisor. No provider or client may
treat an unimplemented verifier as proof of success.

Regenerable runtime data may be reclaimed only through exact registered,
unleased identity. A writer makes status incomplete; after exact effect absence
the daemon remeasures before cleanup. A live or reused process/group identity
keeps finalization pending. Unique retained Changes are never automatic cleanup
targets, and the daemon does not claim an instantaneous filesystem byte ceiling.

## Clients and integrations

`factoryctl` and the hosted browser are disposable clients of one local API;
neither owns runtime state. `factoryctl` uses the operator credential, while a
paired browser uses its scoped durable browser authority. Browser task
submission, like CLI task submission, is applied by the daemon's durable queue
and does not bypass dispatch or provider admission.
Browser selection is pinned to canonical state heads and never polls
or sleeps across lifecycle boundaries. Stale discovery is treated as stale, not
as authority for a retry or an old absence. Attempt commands read the private
credential file for their exact run; an attempt cannot cross into operator
authority.

## State outside SQLite

The local socket and runtime roots are private daemon-owned files. The live
operator home and launchd job are never test fixtures.

## Deliberate non-goals

- No new package, ORM, actor framework, repository/service interface with one
  implementation, generic saga, or event-sourcing framework.
- No protection from a hostile process running as the operator. Bearer scoping
  prevents confused/cooperative cross-attempt behavior; real isolation needs a
  separate OS user, container, or sandbox.
